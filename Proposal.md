# The Ansible Proposal process

The Core committee is responsible for evolving Ansible (the language), and authoring the specification. The committee operates by consensus and has discretion to alter the specification as it sees fit. However, the general process for making changes to the specification is as follows:

## Development
Changes to the language are developed by way of a process which provides guidelines for evolving an addition from an idea to a fully specified feature, complete with acceptance tests and multiple implementations. There are four "maturity" stages. The Core committee must approve acceptance for each stage.

## | | Stage | Purpose | Entrance Criteria | Acceptance Signifies | Spec Quality | Post-Acceptance Changes Expected | Implementation Types Expected |
